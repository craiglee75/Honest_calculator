# Honest_calculator
Basic calculator ran via the Terminal using + - * / operations and the ability to store results.

You can run this program from the Terminal using python3 honest_calculator.py
Results are stored to the 'M' variable for use in further calculations.
In terminal prompts provide guidance.

My version of the calculator was created as part of jet brains tutorials from their core python course.
